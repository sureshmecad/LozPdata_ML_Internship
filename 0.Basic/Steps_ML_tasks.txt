Steps to be followed in ML Task :
----------------------------------

1. Importing the Dataset 
2. Checking Information
3. Checking whether any characters are there 
and if yes convert to Numeric - Enumeration process
4.We will nurmaize the data and split it to test and train.
# We choose to splite 30-70 because 
we have a small data set and we want to have enught validetionn examples.
# split data table into data X and class labels y.
5. EDA process and Data Visualisation Process :
	- Calculate Coreleation Matrix.
	- Drawing heatmap.
	-Helping function Creation.
6. Doing PCA analysis : Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique 
used to emphasize variation and bring out strong patterns in a dataset.
we use it first make data easy to explore and visualize.
7.Define The Algorithms :
First we will run eatch algorithem on all the features
then we will use SFS to compere and cheack improvment. We will use sfs 
to take aoutimaticaly from 1 to 5 features as the algorithm sujects.
8. Showing Results in Tabular and graphical formats.
